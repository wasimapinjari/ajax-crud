Hi, send your Pull Request over to contribute.<br>
I use VS Code for coding and use tabs in this project (equivalent to 4 spaces).

e.g.
```php
Case 1:
"Two  spaces";
Case 2:
"Single    Tab";

"Look at difference between two words in each case";

"So don't send code like this (using to 2 spaces to indent):";
if ($x = $y) {
  $z = "India";
}

"Send code like this (using 'Tab' keyboard button to indent):";
if ($x = $y) {
    $z = "India";
}
```

Don't style code block like this:
```php
if ($x = $y)
{
    $z = "India";
}
else
{
    $z = "USA";
}
```

do this instead:
```php
if ($x = $y) {
    $z = "India";
} else {
    $z = "USA";
}
```
